# rzx_file

The original SDK to read and write RZX gameplay recording files as defined by Ramsoft ZX Spectrum demogroup. 

The file format is used to record and replay someone's play of a game on an emulator, originally for the ZX Spectrum and it's variants and many of it's emulators support it.  

It is pretty clever and could be easily used for other Z80 based computers as well, with some extension for any other CPU, even with memory mapped i/o, as long as memory mapped i/o can be safely distinguished from normal memory r/w. 

When searching for the latest version of the RZX file format i found that information around it almost disappeared and the original SDK could not be found any more. Of course the original ramsoft site is long gone now.

So this repository is to preserve the original SDK and mayby some time i'll make an updated c++ version of it. Time will show. Maybe some else feels challended.
